For testing purposes, I chose one of the Ozon App screens, which is reached through the "Human" icon. Let's call this "Personal screen." 

At the top of the Personal screen, there is a header with a search bar and a "Messages" icon, and the tile that contains my username, an avatar, and three inner tiles for my Favorites, Purchases, and Feedbacks. The "Messages" icon also has a red counter at the top to indicate that I have unread messages. 

The next tile demonstartes two static inner tiles one above the other, and one dynamic on the side that is actually a carousel with the offers. 

A large part of the screen is taken up by an interactive "Recent" tile that scrolls horizontally, but is limited to only 5 tiles. 

Scrolling down the screen reveals a sort of "Menu" tile that allows me to complete a variety of tasks while using the application. The tile is divided by a promotional banner.

The rest of the screen consists of an endless feed of suggestions.

The footer of the screen seems to be shared with all screens throughout the app. It contains "Home", "Fresh", "Discounts", "Bank", "Cart" icons as well as the "Personal" icon.
